# AGENTS.md

GROWI is a team collaboration wiki platform built with Next.js, Express, and MongoDB. This guide provides essential instructions for AI coding agents working with the GROWI codebase.

## Language Policy

**Response Language**: If the user writes in a non-English language at any point in the conversation, always respond in that language from that point onward. This rule takes **absolute priority** over any other language instructions, including skill/command prompts or context documents written in English.

**Code Comments**: When generating source code, all comments and explanations within the code must be written in English, regardless of the conversation language.

## Project Overview

GROWI is a team collaboration wiki platform using Markdown, featuring hierarchical page organization, real-time collaborative editing, authentication integrations, and plugin support. Built as a monorepo with Next.js, Express, and MongoDB.

## Knowledge Base

### Always-Loaded Context

**Rules** (`.claude/rules/`) — loaded into every session automatically:

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **project-structure** | Monorepo layout, @growi/core role, build order, Changeset workflow |
| **coding-style** | Coding conventions, naming, exports, immutability, comments |
| **security** | Security checklist, secret management, OWASP vulnerability prevention |
| **performance** | Model selection, context management, build troubleshooting |
| **github-cli** | **CRITICAL**: gh CLI auth required; stop immediately if unauthenticated |

| **testing** | Test commands, pnpm vitest usage |
| **mongodb-regex** | `RegExp.escape()` breaks MongoDB PCRE2 for non-ASCII whitespace; use `escapeStringForMongoRegex` for query-bound patterns |

### On-Demand Skills

**Agents** (specialized subagents):

| Agent | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **build-error-resolver** | TypeScript/build error resolution with minimal diffs |
| **security-reviewer** | Security vulnerability detection, OWASP Top 10 |

**Commands** (user-invocable via `/`):

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **/learn** | Extract reusable patterns from sessions |

**apps/app Skills** (load via Skill tool when working in apps/app):

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **app-architecture** | Next.js Pages Router, Express, feature-based structure |
| **app-commands** | apps/app specific commands (migrations, OpenAPI, etc.) |
| **app-specific-patterns** | Jotai/SWR patterns, router mocking, API routes |

### Package-Specific CLAUDE.md

Each application has its own CLAUDE.md with detailed instructions:

- `apps/app/CLAUDE.md` - Main GROWI application
- `apps/pdf-converter/CLAUDE.md` - PDF conversion microservice
- `apps/slackbot-proxy/CLAUDE.md` - Slack integration proxy

## Quick Reference

### Essential Commands (Global)

```bash
# Development
turbo run dev                    # Start all dev servers

# Quality Checks (use Turborepo for caching)
turbo run lint --filter @growi/app
turbo run test --filter @growi/app

# Production
pnpm run app:build              # Build main app
pnpm start                      # Build and start
```

```

## Development Guidelines

1. **Feature-Based Architecture**: Create new features in `features/{feature-name}/`
2. **Server-Client Separation**: Keep server and client code separate
3. **State Management**: Jotai for UI state, SWR for data fetching *(Jotai: atomic/TypeScript-first for UI; SWR: caching/revalidation for server state — don't mix)*
4. **Linter/Formatter**: Biome (replaces ESLint + Prettier); Stylelint for SCSS *(10–100x faster, single config in `biome.json`)*
5. **Frontend Framework**: Next.js Pages Router *(App Router not yet adopted — GROWI predates its stability)*
6. **Named Exports**: Prefer named exports (except Next.js pages)
7. **Test Co-location**: Place test files next to source files
8. **Type Safety**: Use strict TypeScript throughout
9. **Changeset**: Use `npx changeset` for version management

## Before Committing

Always execute these checks:

```bash
# From workspace root (recommended)
turbo run lint --filter @growi/app
turbo run test --filter @growi/app
turbo run build --filter @growi/app
```

Or from apps/app directory:

```bash
pnpm run lint
pnpm run test
pnpm run build
```
