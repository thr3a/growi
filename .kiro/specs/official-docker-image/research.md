# Research & Design Decisions

---
**Purpose**: Discovery findings and design decision rationale for the official Docker image modernization.
---

## Summary
- **Feature**: `official-docker-image`
- **Discovery Scope**: Extension (major improvement of existing Dockerfile)
- **Key Findings**:
  - The DHI runtime image (`dhi.io/node:24-debian13`) is a minimal configuration that does not include a shell, package manager, or coreutils. By adopting a Node.js entrypoint (TypeScript), a configuration requiring no shell or additional binaries is achieved
  - `--mount=type=bind` is impractical for monorepo multi-step builds. `turbo prune --docker` is the officially recommended Docker optimization approach by Turborepo
  - gosu is replaced by Node.js native `process.setuid/setgid`. External binaries (gosu/setpriv/busybox) are completely unnecessary
  - HEALTHCHECK is not adopted (k8s uses its own probes. Docker Compose users can configure it themselves)
  - Node.js 24 supports native TypeScript execution (type stripping). The entrypoint can be written in TypeScript

## Research Log

### DHI Runtime Image Configuration

- **Context**: Investigation of constraints when adopting `dhi.io/node:24-debian13` as the base image for the release stage
- **Sources Consulted**:
  - [DHI Catalog GitHub](https://github.com/docker-hardened-images/catalog) — `image/node/debian-13/` directory
  - [DHI Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/dhi/)
  - [DHI Use an Image](https://docs.docker.com/dhi/how-to/use/)
- **Findings**:
  - Pre-installed packages in the runtime image: only `base-files`, `ca-certificates`, `libc6`, `libgomp1`, `libstdc++6`, `netbase`, `tzdata`
  - **No shell**, **no apt**, **no coreutils**, **no curl/wget**
  - Default user: `node` (UID 1000, GID 1000)
  - Dev image (`-dev`): `apt`, `bash`, `git`, `util-linux`, `coreutils`, etc. are pre-installed
  - Available tags: `dhi.io/node:24-debian13`, `dhi.io/node:24-debian13-dev`
  - Platforms: `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`
- **Implications**:
  - By writing the entrypoint in Node.js (TypeScript), neither a shell nor additional binaries are needed at all
  - gosu/setpriv are replaced by Node.js native `process.setuid/setgid`. No need to copy external binaries
  - HEALTHCHECK is not adopted (k8s uses its own probes). Health checks via curl/Node.js http module are unnecessary

### Applicability of `--mount=type=bind` in Monorepo Builds

- **Context**: Investigation of the feasibility of Requirement 3.1 "Use `--mount=type=bind` instead of `COPY . .` in the builder stage"
- **Sources Consulted**:
  - [Docker Build Cache Optimization](https://docs.docker.com/build/cache/optimize/)
  - [Dockerfile Reference - RUN --mount](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/)
  - [pnpm Docker Documentation](https://pnpm.io/docker)
  - [Turborepo Docker Guide](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/handbook/deploying-with-docker)
- **Findings**:
  - `--mount=type=bind` is **only valid during the execution of a RUN instruction** and is not carried over to the next RUN instruction
  - In the multi-step process of monorepo builds (install -> build -> deploy), each step depends on artifacts from the previous step, making it difficult to achieve with bind mounts alone
  - It is possible to combine all steps into a single RUN, but this loses the benefits of layer caching
  - **Turborepo official recommendation**: Use `turbo prune --docker` to minimize the monorepo for Docker
    - `out/json/` — only package.json files needed for dependency install
    - `out/pnpm-lock.yaml` — lockfile
    - `out/full/` — source code needed for the build
  - This approach avoids `COPY . .` while leveraging layer caching
- **Implications**:
  - Requirement 3.1 should be achieved using the `turbo prune --docker` pattern instead of `--mount=type=bind`
  - The goal (minimizing source code layers / improving cache efficiency) can be equally achieved
  - **However**, compatibility of `turbo prune --docker` with pnpm workspaces needs to be verified during implementation

### Alternatives to gosu

- **Context**: Investigation of alternatives since gosu is not available in the DHI runtime image
- **Sources Consulted**:
  - [gosu GitHub](https://github.com/tianon/gosu) — list of alternative tools
  - [Debian Packages - gosu in trixie](https://packages.debian.org/trixie/admin/gosu)
  - [PhotoPrism: Switch from gosu to setpriv](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/pull/2730)
  - [MongoDB Docker: Replace gosu by setpriv](https://github.com/docker-library/mongo/pull/714)
  - Node.js `process.setuid/setgid` documentation
- **Findings**:
  - `setpriv` is part of `util-linux` and is pre-installed in the DHI dev image
  - `gosu node command` can be replaced with `setpriv --reuid=node --regid=node --init-groups -- command`
  - PhotoPrism and the official MongoDB Docker image have already migrated from gosu to setpriv
  - **Node.js native**: Can be fully replaced with `process.setgid(1000)` + `process.setuid(1000)` + `process.initgroups('node', 1000)`
  - When adopting a Node.js entrypoint, no external binaries (gosu/setpriv/busybox) are needed at all
- **Implications**:
  - **Final decision**: Adopt Node.js native `process.setuid/setgid` (setpriv is also unnecessary)
  - No need to copy gosu/setpriv binaries, resulting in no additional binaries in the release stage
  - Maintains the minimized attack surface of the DHI runtime as-is

### HEALTHCHECK Implementation Approach (Not Adopted)

- **Context**: Investigation of HEALTHCHECK implementation approaches since curl is not available in the DHI runtime image
- **Sources Consulted**:
  - [Docker Healthchecks in Distroless Node.js](https://www.mattknight.io/blog/docker-healthchecks-in-distroless-node-js)
  - [Docker Healthchecks: Why Not to Use curl](https://blog.sixeyed.com/docker-healthchecks-why-not-to-use-curl-or-iwr/)
  - GROWI healthcheck endpoint: `apps/app/src/server/routes/apiv3/healthcheck.ts`
- **Findings**:
  - Node.js `http` module is sufficient (curl is unnecessary)
  - GROWI's `/_api/v3/healthcheck` endpoint returns `{ status: 'OK' }` without any parameters
  - Docker HEALTHCHECK is useful for Docker Compose's `depends_on: service_healthy` dependency order control
  - In k8s environments, custom probes (liveness/readiness) are used, so the Dockerfile's HEALTHCHECK is unnecessary
- **Implications**:
  - **Final decision: Not adopted**. k8s uses its own probes, and Docker Compose users can configure it themselves in compose.yaml
  - By not including HEALTHCHECK in the Dockerfile, simplicity is maintained

### Shell Dependency of npm run migrate

- **Context**: Investigation of whether `npm run migrate` within CMD requires a shell
- **Sources Consulted**:
  - GROWI `apps/app/package.json`'s `migrate` script
- **Findings**:
  - The actual `migrate` script content: `node -r dotenv-flow/config node_modules/migrate-mongo/bin/migrate-mongo up -f config/migrate-mongo-config.js`
  - `npm run` internally uses `sh -c`, so a shell is required
  - Alternative: Running the script contents directly with node eliminates the need for npm/sh
  - However, using npm run is more maintainable (can track changes in package.json)
- **Implications**:
  - **Final decision**: Use `child_process.execFileSync` in the Node.js entrypoint to directly execute the migration command (not using npm run, no shell needed)
  - Adopt the approach of directly writing the `migrate` script contents within the entrypoint
  - When package.json changes, the entrypoint also needs to be updated, but priority is given to fully shell-less DHI runtime

### Node.js 24 Native TypeScript Execution

- **Context**: Investigation of whether Node.js 24's native TypeScript execution feature can be used when writing the entrypoint in TypeScript
- **Sources Consulted**:
  - [Node.js 23 Release Notes](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v23.0.0) — `--experimental-strip-types` unflagged
  - [Node.js Type Stripping Documentation](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/typescript.html)
- **Findings**:
  - From Node.js 23, type stripping is enabled by default (no `--experimental-strip-types` flag needed)
  - Available as a stable feature in Node.js 24
  - **Constraint**: "Non-erasable syntax" such as enum and namespace cannot be used. `--experimental-transform-types` is required for those
  - interface, type alias, and type annotations (`: string`, `: number`, etc.) can be used without issues
  - Can be executed directly with `ENTRYPOINT ["node", "docker-entrypoint.ts"]`
- **Implications**:
  - The entrypoint can be written in TypeScript, enabling type-safe implementation
  - Do not use enum; use union types (`type Foo = 'a' | 'b'`) as alternatives
  - tsconfig.json is not required (type stripping operates independently)

## Architecture Pattern Evaluation

| Option | Description | Strengths | Risks / Limitations | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-----------|---------------------|-------|
| DHI runtime + busybox-static | Copy busybox-static to provide sh/coreutils | Minimal addition (~1MB) enables full functionality | Contradicts the original intent of DHI adoption (minimizing attack surface). Additional binaries are attack vectors | Rejected |
| DHI runtime + bash/coreutils copy | Copy bash and various binaries individually from the dev stage | Full bash functionality available | Shared library dependencies are complex, many files need to be copied | Rejected |
| DHI dev image as runtime | Use the dev image as-is for production | Minimal configuration changes | Increased attack surface due to apt/git etc., diminishes the meaning of DHI | Rejected |
| Node.js entrypoint (TypeScript, shell-less) | Write the entrypoint in TypeScript. Runs with Node.js 24's native TypeScript execution | Completely shell-free, maintains DHI runtime's attack surface as-is, type-safe | Migration command written directly (not using npm run), updates needed when package.json changes | **Adopted** |

## Design Decisions

### Decision: Node.js TypeScript Entrypoint (Completely Shell-Free)

- **Context**: The DHI runtime image contains neither a shell nor coreutils. Copying busybox-static contradicts the intent of DHI adoption (minimizing attack surface)
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. Copy busybox-static to provide shell + coreutils — Contradicts DHI's attack surface minimization
  2. Copy bash + coreutils individually — Complex dependencies
  3. Node.js TypeScript entrypoint — Everything can be accomplished with `fs`, `child_process`, and `process.setuid/setgid`
- **Selected Approach**: Write the entrypoint in TypeScript (`docker-entrypoint.ts`). Execute directly using Node.js 24's native TypeScript execution (type stripping)
- **Rationale**: No additional binaries needed in the DHI runtime whatsoever. Directory operations via fs module, privilege dropping via process.setuid/setgid, migration via execFileSync, and app startup via spawn. Improved maintainability through type safety
- **Trade-offs**: Migration command is written directly (not using npm run). When the migrate script in package.json changes, the entrypoint also needs to be updated
- **Follow-up**: Verify that Node.js 24's type stripping works correctly with a single-file entrypoint without import statements

### Decision: Privilege Dropping via Node.js Native process.setuid/setgid

- **Context**: gosu cannot be installed in the DHI runtime. busybox-static/setpriv are also not adopted (policy of eliminating additional binaries)
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. Copy gosu binary — Works but goes against industry trends
  2. Copy setpriv binary — Works but goes against the policy of eliminating additional binaries
  3. Node.js `process.setuid/setgid` — Standard Node.js API
  4. Docker `--user` flag — Cannot handle dynamic processing in the entrypoint
- **Selected Approach**: Drop privileges with `process.initgroups('node', 1000)` + `process.setgid(1000)` + `process.setuid(1000)`
- **Rationale**: No external binaries needed at all. Can be called directly within the Node.js entrypoint. Safe privilege dropping in the order setgid -> setuid
- **Trade-offs**: The entrypoint starts as a Node.js process running as root, and the app becomes its child process (not an exec like gosu). However, the app process is separated via spawn, and signal forwarding fulfills PID 1 responsibilities
- **Follow-up**: None

### Decision: turbo prune --docker Pattern

- **Context**: Requirement 3.1 requires eliminating `COPY . .`, but `--mount=type=bind` is impractical for monorepo builds
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. `--mount=type=bind` — Does not persist across RUN instructions, unsuitable for multi-step builds
  2. Combine all steps into a single RUN — Poor cache efficiency
  3. `turbo prune --docker` — Officially recommended by Turborepo
- **Selected Approach**: Use `turbo prune --docker` to minimize the monorepo for Docker, using optimized COPY patterns
- **Rationale**: Officially recommended by Turborepo. Separates dependency install and source copy to maximize layer cache utilization. Eliminates `COPY . .` while remaining practical
- **Trade-offs**: One additional build stage (pruner stage), but offset by improved cache efficiency
- **Follow-up**: Verify `turbo prune --docker` compatibility with pnpm workspaces during implementation

### Decision: Flag Injection via spawn Arguments

- **Context**: `--max-heap-size` cannot be used in `NODE_OPTIONS`. It needs to be passed as a direct argument to the node command
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. Export environment variable `GROWI_NODE_FLAGS` and inject via shell variable expansion in CMD — Requires a shell
  2. Rewrite CMD string with sed in the entrypoint — Fragile
  3. Pass directly as arguments to `child_process.spawn` in the Node.js entrypoint — No shell needed
- **Selected Approach**: Build a flag array within the entrypoint and pass it directly with `spawn(process.execPath, [...nodeFlags, ...appArgs])`
- **Rationale**: No shell variable expansion needed. Passed directly as an array, resulting in zero risk of shell injection. Natural integration with the Node.js entrypoint
- **Trade-offs**: CMD becomes unnecessary (the entrypoint handles all startup processing). Overriding the command with docker run does not affect the logic within the entrypoint
- **Follow-up**: None

### DHI Registry Authentication and CI/CD Integration

- **Context**: Investigation of the authentication method required for pulling DHI base images and how to integrate with the existing CodeBuild pipeline
- **Sources Consulted**:
  - [DHI How to Use an Image](https://docs.docker.com/dhi/how-to/use/) — DHI usage instructions
  - Existing `apps/app/docker/codebuild/buildspec.yml` — Current CodeBuild build definition
  - Existing `apps/app/docker/codebuild/secretsmanager.tf` — AWS Secrets Manager configuration
- **Findings**:
  - DHI uses Docker Hub credentials (DHI is a feature of Docker Business/Team subscriptions)
  - Authentication is possible with `docker login dhi.io --username <dockerhub-user> --password-stdin`
  - The existing buildspec.yml is already logged into docker.io with the `DOCKER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD` secret
  - The same credentials can be used to log into `dhi.io` as well (no additional secrets required)
  - The flow of CodeBuild's `reusable-app-build-image.yml` -> CodeBuild Project -> buildspec.yml does not need to change
- **Implications**:
  - Can be addressed by simply adding one line of `docker login dhi.io` to the pre_build in buildspec.yml
  - No changes to `secretsmanager.tf` are needed
  - Login to both Docker Hub and DHI is required (docker.io for push, dhi.io for pull)

### Impact Scope of Directory Replacement (Codebase Investigation)

- **Context**: Confirming that existing references will not break when replacing `apps/app/docker-new/` with `apps/app/docker/`
- **Sources Consulted**: Grep investigation of the entire codebase with the `apps/app/docker` keyword
- **Findings**:
  - `buildspec.yml`: `-f ./apps/app/docker/Dockerfile` — Same path after replacement (no change needed)
  - `codebuild.tf`: `buildspec = "apps/app/docker/codebuild/buildspec.yml"` — Same (no change needed)
  - `.github/workflows/release.yml`: `readme-filepath: ./apps/app/docker/README.md` — Same (no change needed)
  - `.github/workflows/ci-app.yml` / `ci-app-prod.yml`: `!apps/app/docker/**` exclusion pattern — Same (no change needed)
  - `apps/app/bin/github-actions/update-readme.sh`: `cd docker` + sed — Same (no change needed)
  - Within Dockerfile: line 122 `apps/app/docker-new/docker-entrypoint.ts` — **Needs updating** (self-referencing path)
  - `package.json` and `vitest.config` for docker-related references — None
  - `lefthook.yml` for docker-related hooks — None
- **Implications**:
  - Only one location within the Dockerfile (self-referencing path) needs to be updated during replacement
  - All external references (CI/CD, GitHub Actions) already use the `apps/app/docker/` path and require no changes
  - The `codebuild/` directory and `README.md` are maintained as-is within `docker/`

### Environment Variable Renaming: GROWI_ prefix → V8_ prefix

- **Context**: The initial implementation used `GROWI_HEAP_SIZE`, `GROWI_OPTIMIZE_MEMORY`, and `GROWI_LITE_MODE` as environment variable names. These names obscure the relationship between the env var and the underlying V8 flag it controls
- **Motivation**: Align environment variable names with the actual V8 option names they map to, improving discoverability and self-documentation
- **Mapping**:
  | Old Name | New Name | V8 Flag |
  |----------|----------|---------|
  | `GROWI_HEAP_SIZE` | `V8_MAX_HEAP_SIZE` | `--max-heap-size` |
  | `GROWI_OPTIMIZE_MEMORY` | `V8_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE` | `--optimize-for-size` |
  | `GROWI_LITE_MODE` | `V8_LITE_MODE` | `--lite-mode` |
- **Benefits**:
  - Users can immediately understand which V8 flag each variable controls
  - Naming convention is consistent: `V8_` prefix + option name in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
  - No need to consult documentation to understand the mapping
- **Impact scope**:
  - `docker-entrypoint.ts`: Code changes (env var reads, comments, log messages)
  - `docker-entrypoint.spec.ts`: Test updates (env var references in test cases)
  - `README.md`: Add documentation for the new environment variables
  - `design.md`, `requirements.md`, `tasks.md`: Spec document updates
- **Breaking change**: Yes — users who have configured `GROWI_HEAP_SIZE`, `GROWI_OPTIMIZE_MEMORY`, or `GROWI_LITE_MODE` in their docker-compose.yml or deployment configs will need to update to the new names. This is acceptable as these variables were introduced in the same release (v7.5.x) and have not been published yet
- **Implications**: No backward compatibility shim needed since the variables are new in this version

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Stability of Node.js 24 native TypeScript execution**: Type stripping was unflagged in Node.js 23. It is a stable feature in Node.js 24. However, non-erasable syntax such as enum cannot be used -> Use only interface/type
- **Direct description of migration command**: The `migrate` script from package.json is written directly in the entrypoint, so synchronization is needed when changes occur -> Clearly noted in comments during implementation
- **turbo prune compatibility with pnpm workspaces**: Verify during implementation. If incompatible, fall back to an optimized COPY pattern
- **Limitations of process.setuid/setgid**: `process.initgroups` is required for supplementary group initialization. The order setgid -> setuid must be strictly followed
- **docker login requirement for DHI images**: `docker login dhi.io` is required in CI/CD. Security considerations for credential management are needed

## Production Implementation Discoveries

### DHI Dev Image Minimal Configuration (Phase 1 E2E)

- **Issue**: The DHI dev image (`dhi.io/node:24-debian13-dev`) did not include the `which` command
- **Resolution**: Changed pnpm installation from `SHELL="$(which sh)"` to `SHELL=/bin/sh`
- **Impact**: Minor — only affects the pnpm install script invocation

### Complete Absence of Shell in DHI Runtime Image (Phase 1 E2E)

- **Issue**: The DHI runtime image (`dhi.io/node:24-debian13`) did not have `/bin/sh`. The design planned `--mount=type=bind,from=builder` + `RUN tar -zxf`, but `RUN` instructions require `/bin/sh`
- **Resolution**:
  - **builder stage**: Changed from `tar -zcf` to `cp -a` into a staging directory `/tmp/release/`
  - **release stage**: Changed from `RUN --mount=type=bind... tar -zxf` to `COPY --from=builder --chown=node:node`
- **Impact**: Design Req 3.5 (`--mount=type=bind,from=builder` pattern) was replaced with `COPY --from=builder`. The security goal of not requiring a shell at runtime was achieved even more robustly
- **Lesson**: DHI runtime images are truly minimal — `COPY`, `WORKDIR`, `ENV`, `LABEL`, `ENTRYPOINT` are processed by the Docker daemon and do not require a shell

### process.initgroups() Type Definition Gap

- **Issue**: `process.initgroups('node', 1000)` was called for in the design, but implementation was deferred because the type definition does not exist in `@types/node`
- **Status**: Deferred (Known Issue)
- **Runtime**: `process.initgroups` does exist at runtime in Node.js 24
- **Workaround options**: Wait for `@types/node` fix, or use `(process as any).initgroups('node', 1000)`
- **Practical impact**: Low — the node user in a Docker container typically has no supplementary groups
